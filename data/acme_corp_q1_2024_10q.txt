Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue

Our total revenue for Q1 2024 was $642.0 million, representing an increase of $81.5 million, or 14.5%,
compared to $560.5 million for Q1 2023. This growth was primarily driven by:

1. Product Revenue Growth: Product revenue increased by $72.9 million, or 17.7%, from $412.3 million
   in Q1 2023 to $485.2 million in Q1 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to:
   - Strong demand for our enterprise AI platform, which contributed $45 million in incremental revenue
   - Expansion in the healthcare vertical, adding $18 million
   - Growth in our cloud infrastructure offerings, contributing $9.9 million

2. Service Revenue Growth: Service revenue increased by $8.6 million, or 5.8%, from $148.2 million
   in Q1 2023 to $156.8 million in Q1 2024. This was driven by:
   - Professional services associated with new enterprise deployments
   - Increased customer success and training engagements

Geographic Revenue Analysis:
- North America: $385.2 million (60% of total, up 12% year-over-year)
- Europe: $160.1 million (25% of total, up 18% year-over-year)
- Asia-Pacific: $96.7 million (15% of total, up 21% year-over-year)

Customer Metrics:
- Total customers: 12,450 (up from 10,890 in Q1 2023, representing 14.3% growth)
- Enterprise customers (>$100k ARR): 890 (up from 720, representing 23.6% growth)
- Net revenue retention rate: 118%

The sequential quarter-over-quarter comparison (Q1 2024 vs Q4 2023) shows revenue increased by
8.2% from $593.4 million to $642.0 million, exceeding our guidance of 6-7% sequential growth.

Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin

Our gross margin for Q1 2024 was 50.0%, compared to 46.3% for Q1 2023, representing a 370 basis
point improvement. This improvement was driven by:
- Improved product mix with higher-margin software revenue
- Operating leverage from infrastructure investments made in 2023
- Reduced cloud computing costs due to optimization initiatives

Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses increased by $29.2 million, or 13.4%, from $218.6 million in Q1 2023 to
$247.8 million in Q1 2024. However, as a percentage of revenue, operating expenses decreased from
39.0% to 38.6%, demonstrating improved operating leverage.

Research and Development: R&D expenses increased by $11.1 million, or 14.2%, primarily due to
headcount growth of 145 employees in engineering and increased investment in AI model development.

Sales and Marketing: S&M expenses increased by $14.6 million, or 14.9%, reflecting our continued
investment in go-to-market expansion, particularly in the enterprise segment and international markets.

Cash Flow and Liquidity

Cash flow from operations for Q1 2024 was $68.5 million, compared to $42.1 million in Q1 2023,
representing a 62.7% increase. This strong cash generation reflects our improved profitability
and efficient working capital management.

As of March 31, 2024, we had:
- Cash and cash equivalents: $425.3 million
- Short-term investments: $180.7 million
- Total liquidity: $606.0 million

Outlook

For Q2 2024, we expect:
- Revenue in the range of $665-$680 million (representing 13-16% year-over-year growth)
- Non-GAAP operating margin of 15-16%
- Continued investment in product development and international expansion

For the full fiscal year 2024, we are raising our revenue guidance to $2.75-$2.80 billion,
representing 16-18% year-over-year growth, up from our previous guidance of $2.68-$2.73 billion.

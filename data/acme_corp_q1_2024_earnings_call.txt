Jessica Park (VP Investor Relations):

Good afternoon, and welcome to ACME Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.
I'm Jessica Park, VP of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Sarah Chen, our Chief Executive
Officer, and Michael Roberts, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking
statements regarding our business outlook and future financial performance. Please refer to the
safe harbor statement in our earnings release for more information.

I'll now turn the call over to Sarah.

================================================================================

Sarah Chen (CEO):

Thank you, Jessica, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm thrilled to report another exceptional
quarter for ACME Corporation. Q1 2024 was a landmark quarter that exceeded our expectations
across all key metrics.

Let me start with the headline: we delivered outstanding revenue growth while significantly
expanding our margins and accelerating our path to sustainable profitability. But what I'm most
excited about is the momentum we're seeing in the business and the validation of our strategic
vision.

Now, let me address the revenue growth that everyone's interested in. When we look at our Q1
performance, I want to be crystal clear about what we achieved and why it matters. Our revenue
came in at $642 million, which represents phenomenal growth. But here's what's really important -
and this is something I want to emphasize - when you look at the underlying drivers of this growth,
you see a business that's firing on all cylinders.

We grew revenue by approximately 15% year-over-year. Now, I know some of you might look at that
number and think "that's good, but not spectacular." But let me give you the context that matters.
This growth was broad-based across all our product lines, all geographic regions, and most
importantly, it came with exceptional margin expansion. We're not buying growth - we're earning it
through product excellence and operational discipline.

What's particularly impressive - and this is where I get really excited - is that this 15%
year-over-year growth actually accelerated from Q4, where we grew 12% year-over-year. So we're
seeing acceleration in the business, not deceleration. That's the trend that matters.

And when I talk to our largest customers, what they tell me is that we're still in the early
innings of their AI transformation journey. Our enterprise AI platform isn't just another product
for them - it's becoming mission-critical infrastructure. We're seeing deal sizes expand, we're
seeing faster deployment cycles, and we're seeing customers who started with one use case now
rolling out our platform across their entire organization.

Let me share a specific example that illustrates our momentum. In Q1, we closed our largest deal
ever - a $12 million annual contract with a Fortune 100 healthcare company. This customer started
with a small pilot just nine months ago. They've now standardized on our platform across 15
different business units. That's the kind of expansion we're seeing across our customer base, and
it's why our net revenue retention rate is at 118%.

On the product front, we made significant advances in Q1. We launched version 3.0 of our enterprise
AI platform, which includes breakthrough capabilities in multi-modal AI and real-time decision
intelligence. The early customer feedback has been phenomenal. We're seeing adoption rates 2-3x
faster than our previous major release.

We also made strategic investments in our international expansion. We opened new offices in London
and Singapore, and we're seeing tremendous traction in those markets. Europe grew 18% year-over-year,
and Asia-Pacific grew an impressive 21%. These markets represent enormous long-term opportunities,
and we're investing to win.

Now, let me talk about profitability, because this is where the story gets even better. We
expanded our gross margin to 50%, up from 46% a year ago. This isn't just about scale - it's
about the fundamental strength of our business model. We're proving that you can grow fast and
expand margins simultaneously when you have truly differentiated technology.

Our operating margin also improved significantly. We're demonstrating real operating leverage as
we scale. Every dollar of incremental revenue is more profitable than the last, and that's exactly
the trajectory investors should want to see.

On the cash flow front, we generated $68.5 million in operating cash flow, up 63% year-over-year.
This strong cash generation gives us tremendous flexibility to invest in growth while maintaining
a fortress balance sheet with over $600 million in total liquidity.

Looking ahead, I've never been more confident in our strategy and execution. The market opportunity
is massive - we estimate the total addressable market for enterprise AI is over $300 billion and
growing rapidly. We have best-in-class technology, an exceptional team, and strong customer
momentum.

For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $665-$680 million, representing 13-16% year-over-year
growth. For the full year, we're raising our revenue guidance to $2.75-$2.80 billion, up from our
previous guidance. This implies roughly 16-18% growth for the full year, with continued margin
expansion.

But here's what I want to leave you with: the numbers are strong, but they don't fully capture
the transformation happening in our business. We're becoming the mission-critical AI infrastructure
for the world's most sophisticated enterprises. We're solving problems that no one else can solve.
And we're doing it profitably, with strong unit economics and a clear path to even greater
profitability.

The opportunity ahead of us is enormous, and I'm confident we have the right strategy, the right
team, and the right technology to capitalize on it.

With that, I'll turn it over to Michael to walk through the financial details.

================================================================================

Michael Roberts (CFO):

Thanks, Sarah. I'll provide additional detail on our Q1 financial performance and then open it
up for questions.

As Sarah mentioned, we delivered $642 million in total revenue, up 14.5% year-over-year. To break
that down further:

Product revenue was $485.2 million, up 17.7% year-over-year. This was driven primarily by our
enterprise AI platform, which grew over 35% year-over-year. We're seeing particularly strong demand
in the healthcare and financial services verticals.

Service revenue was $156.8 million, up 5.8% year-over-year. While this grew more slowly than product
revenue, this is actually a positive indicator - it shows that our platform is becoming more
self-service and easier to deploy, which improves our unit economics.

From a geographic perspective, North America represented 60% of revenue and grew 12% year-over-year.
International was 40% of revenue and grew 19% year-over-year. We're successfully diversifying our
revenue base geographically, which reduces concentration risk and expands our market opportunity.

Our customer metrics remain extremely strong. We ended Q1 with 12,450 total customers, up 14%
year-over-year. More importantly, our enterprise customer count - customers paying more than $100,000
annually - grew 24% to 890 customers. These enterprise customers now represent over 70% of our total
revenue, up from 65% a year ago. This shift toward larger customers improves our revenue quality and
predictability.

Net revenue retention was 118%, consistent with the last several quarters. This metric is particularly
important because it shows that our existing customers are expanding their usage significantly. A
retention rate above 110% is generally considered best-in-class for enterprise software.

[Financial details continue...]

I'll now open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION

Analyst 1 (Goldman Sachs):

Thanks for taking my question. Sarah, you mentioned 15% year-over-year revenue growth in your
prepared remarks, but the 10-Q shows 14.5%. Can you clarify the difference, and what's driving
the acceleration you mentioned?

Sarah Chen (CEO):

Great question. When I said "approximately 15%," I was rounding for ease of communication. The
precise number is 14.5%, as stated in our 10-Q filing. The key point I wanted to emphasize is that
we're seeing acceleration on a sequential basis - Q4 was 12% year-over-year, and Q1 was 14.5%.
That's 250 basis points of acceleration, which is significant and reflects the strengthening demand
environment and our strong execution.

The drivers of this acceleration are multiple: first, we're seeing larger deal sizes as AI adoption
moves from pilots to production deployments. Second, our sales productivity improved significantly -
our quota-carrying reps are closing deals faster and at higher average contract values. Third, we're
benefiting from the product enhancements we made in late 2023, which are driving higher win rates.

So while the absolute number is 14.5%, the trend is what matters most, and that trend is very
positive.

Analyst 2 (Morgan Stanley):

Following up on that, how should we think about the sustainability of this growth rate? Can you
maintain this level of growth as you scale?

Sarah Chen (CEO):

That's the key question, right? Look, we're not immune to the law of large numbers - at some point,
as we get bigger, maintaining high growth rates becomes more challenging mathematically. However,
I'd point to several factors that give me confidence in sustained growth:

First, our market is huge and growing. Enterprise AI spend is projected to grow at over 30% CAGR
for the next five years. We're well-positioned in that market with differentiated technology.

Second, we're still massively underpenetrated. Even among our existing enterprise customers, the
average customer is using our platform for only 2-3 use cases. We see opportunity to expand to
10-15 use cases per customer. That expansion opportunity alone could drive significant growth.

Third, we're investing heavily in innovation. We have several major product initiatives in our
pipeline that will open up new market segments and use cases.

So while I can't promise we'll maintain exactly 15% growth forever, I'm highly confident we can
sustain double-digit growth for the foreseeable future while continuing to expand margins. That's
a rare combination in enterprise software, and it's what makes our business model so compelling.
